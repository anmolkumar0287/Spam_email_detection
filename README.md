# Spam_email_detection



**Abstract**


In this paper, i have build a spam detector model  using **Naive bayes  Machine Learning** appoach and evaluate that with test data using different performance metrics used. The dataset I used was from a shuffled sample of email subjects and bodies containing both spam and ham emails in different proportions, which I have converted into lemmas. As per my analysis, Naive Bayes model worked well for spam detection with **accuracy upto 95.5% on testing data**.
